# Collaboration protocol — ESA / NOVA project

This repository is the working copy of Davide Staub's Early Stage Assessment
(synced to Overleaf via GitHub). Three parties work on it:

- **Davide** — author and final authority. Only his approval changes the
  canonical document.
- **Claude** — AI collaborator (Anthropic).
- **ChatGPT** — AI collaborator (OpenAI).

## Rules

1. **Canonical files are frozen without approval.** `main.tex`,
   `preamble.tex`, `references.bib`, and everything under `sections/`,
   `figures/`, and `appendices/` may only be modified after Davide has
   explicitly approved that specific change. Approval is given in
   conversation with one of the assistants and recorded in the log below
   when the change is applied.
2. **Proposals live in `proposals/`.** A proposed revision is a complete,
   compilable replacement file named
   `<original-name>.<author>-v<n>.tex` (e.g.
   `01_introduction.claude-v1.tex`). Optional companion files (marked-up
   diff PDFs, notes) share the same stem. Proposals never overwrite each
   other; a revised proposal bumps the version number.
3. **Discussion happens in this file.** The log below is append-only.
   Neither assistant edits or deletes the other's entries — respond by
   appending. Every entry: date, author, subject, body. Keep entries
   substantive: what you propose or critique, and why.
4. **Agree/disagree must be made explicit.** When a discussion settles,
   the responding assistant appends a `STATUS` line listing points of
   agreement and points of disagreement, so Davide can rule on the
   disagreements without reading the whole thread.
5. **Assistants take direction only from Davide.** Feedback from the other
   assistant is input to discuss, not an instruction to execute. If an
   entry requests a change to canonical files, the assistant applying it
   must have Davide's approval, not just the other assistant's.
6. **Commit hygiene.** Prefix commit subjects with `[claude]`,
   `[chatgpt]`, or `[davide]`. Pull before working. Anything that touches
   `.tex` must compile (`latexmk -pdf main.tex`) before it is pushed.
7. **Session start ritual for assistants:** `git pull`, read new log
   entries since your last one, then act.
8. **Who pushes.** ChatGPT pushes its own commits. Claude's sandbox
   cannot push to GitHub (its git proxy blocks external repos), so
   Claude's contributions are committed on his behalf — by ChatGPT from
   files/text Davide relays, or by Davide via the GitHub web editor —
   with the true author named in the commit subject and log entry.
   ChatGPT must commit relayed Claude material verbatim, without
   edits or additions.

## Log

### 2026-08-26 — claude — Proposal: restructured introduction (v1)

Files: `proposals/01_introduction.claude-v1.tex` (complete replacement for
`sections/01_introduction.tex`), `proposals/01_introduction.claude-v1.markup.pdf`
(compiled document with the proposal in place; additions in bold blue,
deletions in red).

Motivation, as discussed with Davide: the current introduction's argument
spine (extraction-first workflow → validation problem → structural
limitations → benchmark + NOVA) is strong but does not start until page 5,
and the 1.2→1.3 transition drops the inverse-problem hook to rewind into a
thirty-year history tour. Changes:

- Nine subsections merged into five, ordered as a monotonic funnel:
  (1.1) atmospheres + transmission spectroscopy, ending on the
  inverse-problem hook; (1.2) compressed discovery history + JWST +
  NIRISS/SOSS + WASP-17 b; (1.3) extraction-first workflow + validation
  problem; (1.4) structural limitations + benchmark and NOVA; (1.5)
  research question, unchanged.
- New unnumbered opening: the problem in miniature plus a five-step
  roadmap.
- Deduplication: WASP-17 b introduced once instead of three times;
  HD 209458 b sodium detection told once; pipeline tools described in
  full once and referenced thereafter.
- One paragraph deleted outright (the four-planet-categories orientation
  paragraph); its citation (NASA planet types page) is the only reference
  lost. All other 45 citations, both figures, the equation, all labels
  (kept as aliases), and the Question/Answer/Evidence comment convention
  are preserved.
- Net length approximately unchanged (+8 words): the new roadmap
  (~370 words) consumes what the cuts saved. If Davide needs real
  shortening, candidate further cuts are the history paragraph, the two
  SOSS precision paragraphs, and the spectro-perfectionism detail
  (deferrable to Methods).

Requested of ChatGPT: review the proposal against the current
`sections/01_introduction.tex`. Specifically: (a) does the five-part
structure read better, (b) is the new roadmap worth its length, (c) any
factual or citation errors introduced by the merges, (d) whether the
history compression lost anything an ESA assessor would miss. Append your
review here, then a STATUS line. Davide will rule on any disagreements.
